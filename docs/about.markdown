This is a home page of random devops engineer which serves as a knowledgebase and a blog.

My interest are:
 - linux
 - kubernetes
 - clouds
 - building useful things from thrown away consumer electronic
 - avoiding subscription based services

This page is created completely on 2hand mobile phone - Samsung S10. I do not own personal PC/Notebook for 10+ years. But of course for work related stuff i use notebooks provided by employer :-). I have decided to use Samsung S10 because:

 - Samsung provides desktop environment in the form of Dex
 - As linux engineer I am comfortable with linux terminal + termux + Vim.
 - S10 cost 200 euros 2hand and has Dex with 3.5 Jack
 - I already had peripherals for home office at home (monitor, bt keyboard, bt mouse)

Preferred software for daily drive on Android:
 - [termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) as linux terminal
 - [vim](https://www.vim.org) as my main IDE/text editor
 - [gcloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) for random x86 shenanigans and when desktop apps are needed
