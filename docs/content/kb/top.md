## Top cheatsheet

``` bash
top

# E -> Cycle between units (Mib, Gib ...)
# 1 -> See all CPU cores
# t -> Show CPU utilization as a bar rather than number
# m -> Show Memory utilization as a bar rather than number
# z -> Add color (pretty useless)
# c -> See full command with arguments instead of bin only
# u -> Filter processes per user
# k -> kill process (pid will be prompted)
# r -> change nice value of process (pid will be prompted), 20 nicest / -19 power hungry tyrand
# n -> set numer of lines shown
# <Space> -> force top to refresh
# W -> save current config
```
